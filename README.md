# ez-scrcpy

A simple script to manage scrcpy connections.

## Givens

*   This script is designed to work with [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy).
*   The initial guidance for the script was taken from the Genymotion blog post: [scrcpy now works wirelessly](https://www.genymotion.com/blog/open-source-project-scrcpy-now-works-wirelessly/).
*   It is assumed that if a phone is connected, it will have USB debugging enabled.
